<h2>
  A Periodic Table for the X-ray Absorption Spectroscopist 
</h2>

<pre>
    In his workshop he has handmaidens he has forged out of gold
    who can move and who help him in his work. ...  With Athena,
    [Hephaestus is] important in the life of the city.  The two
    [are] the patrons of handicrafts, the arts which along with
    agriculture are the support of civilization.
                                 Mythology, Edith Hamilton
</pre>

<p>

<span class=program>HEPHAESTUS</span> is a program for making calculations useful to the XAS
experimentalist using a periodic table, tables of X-ray absorption
coefficients, and other elemental data.
</p>

<p>
On the left of the <span class=program>HEPHAESTUS</span> window is a stack of icons which are
used to select the different tools.  Clicking on one of the icons
enables that tool.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the <span class=program>HEPHAESTUS</span> window is a status bar which
<span class=program>HEPHAESTUS</span> uses to convey information during the course of operation.
Along with information about the most recently completed calculation,
the status bar shows topical information.  As the mouse passes over an
element in the periodic table, the element name, symbol, and Z number
are displayed.  In the Absorption tool, clicking on an edge or line
energy will display that energy in wavelength units in the status
bar.  In the Standards tool, some information about the plotted data
is displayed in the status bar.
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;Hephaestus&rdquo; menu in the menu bar
provides another way of navigating between the tools.  The mouse can
be used, as can the keyboard.  <span class=key>Alt</span>-<span class=key>e</span> and <span class=key>Alt</span>-<span class=key>h</span> post the
&ldquo;Hephaestus&rdquo; and &ldquo;Help&rdquo; menus.  <span class=key>Control</span>-<span class=key>1</span>
through <span class=key>Control</span>-<span class=key>9</span> change the
display the various tools.  <span class=key>Control</span>-<span class=key>m</span> displays the document in a web browser, while <span class=key>Control</span>-<span class=key>c</span> changes the display to the
configuration tool.

<h2>  Absorption</h2>

<p>

This is the start page for <span class=program>HEPHAESTUS</span> and is used to display
information about edge and line energies for the elements.
</p>

<p>
A periodic table is displayed atop three lists that will be filled in
with data associated with an element.  Clicking on an element in the
periodic table displays data about that element.
</p>

<p>
The data table will be filled with some basic information about the
element, including its name and Z number, its atomic weight, and bulk
density under standard temperature and pressure.  Beneath this table
are two controls for determining the appropriate Z-1 or Z-2 filter to
use in a fluorescence experiment.  The &ldquo;Filter&rdquo; text box will be filled with the likeliest candidate for
the element selected from the periodic table.  This can be edited by
hand.  Clicking the &ldquo;Plot filter&rdquo; button
will display a plot showing the relative locations of the edge energy,
the dominant fluorescence lines, and the filter edge energy.
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;edges&rdquo; table shows the value in eV of
each edge associated with the element selected from the periodic table
and the core-hole lifetime in eV of each edge.  Clicking on a line in
this table will display a message in the status bar giving the edge
energy expressed in wavelength units and the core-hole lifetime
expressed in approximate time units.  Double clicking on a line will
highlight all fluorescence lines associated with that edge in the
&ldquo;lines&rdquo; table.
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;lines&rdquo; table shows the transitions and
emission energies in eV of every line associated with the element
selected from the periodic table.  Also shown is the approximate
strength, or branching ratio, of each line.  The strengths for all
lines associated with a particular edge will sum to 1.  Clicking on a
line in this table will display a message in the status bar giving the
emission energy expressed in wavelength units.

<h3>  Filters</h3>
<p>

The rules for the selection of the filter elements are:
</p>


<ol>
  
<li><p>
For elements below Z=38, assume the K edge is being measured and use
the Z-1 element. 
</p></li>
<li><p>
For elements between Z=39 and Z=57, assume the K edge is being measured
and use the Z-2 element.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Use Br for a Rb absorber because Kr is a silly filter material.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Use Rh for a Ru absorber because nobody wants a Tc filter!
</p></li>
<li><p>
Use I for a Ba absorber because Xe is also a silly filter material.
</p></li>
<li><p>
For elements above Z=57, assume the L3 edge is being measured.  Use the
first element whose K edge is more than 90 eV above the Lalpha1 line
of the absorber.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Use Rb for a U or Np absorber because Kr is still a silly filter material.
</p></li>
<li><p>
For elements below Z=24 (chromium), no filter choice is given.
Filters for lower-Z elements are not used because no element exists
with a K-edge between the line and absorption energies of the
absorber.
</p></li>

&ldquo;Show L edges&rdquo; will be visible.  These are
both toggle buttons.  When pressed, they will disable all elements
that cannot be measured by that edge at the beamline.

<h2>  Formulas</h2>

<p>

This tool is used to compute approximate absorption lengths for common
or user-specified materials.  To the left is a list of materials
commonly found at synchrotron beamlines.  Clicking one of those items
inserts its stoichiometric formula into the &ldquo;Formula&rdquo; box and the density into the &ldquo;Density&rdquo; box.
</p>

<p>
At the top of the right hand part of this tool are controls for
entering the parameters of the absorption length calculation.  The
formula must be a stoichiometric formula using a few simple rules.
</p>


<ol>
  
<li><p>
Element symbols must be first letter capitalized.
</p></li>
<li><p>
White space is unimportant -- it will be removed from the string.  So
will dollar signs, underscores, and curly braces (in an attempt to
handle TeX).  Also a sequence like this: 
&ldquo;/sub 3/&rdquo; will be converted
to &ldquo;3&rdquo; (in an attempt to handle INSPEC).
</p></li>
<li><p>
Numbers can be integers or floating point numbers.  Things like 5,
0.5, 12.87, and .5 are all acceptable, as is exponential notation like
1e-2.  Note that exponential notation must use a leading number to
avoid confusion with element symbols.  That is, 1e-2 is OK, but e-2 is
not.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Uncapitalized symbols or unrecognized symbols will flag an error.
</p></li>
<li><p>
An error will be flagged if the number of open parentheses is different
from the number of close parentheses.
</p></li>
<li><p>
An error will be flagged if any unusual symbols are found in the string.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>

The density is entered in units of specific gravity or grams per
cubic centimeter.  Alternately, units of molarity can be used by
selecting that from the choice menu.
</p>

<p>
Finally, an energy in eV is required at which to make the calculation.

</div>
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of the results printed for BN, with a specific
gravity of 2.29 and at energy of 7800 eV:
</p>


<pre>
      element   number   barns/atom     cm^2/gm
     --------- ----------------------------------
        B	     1.000	30.084	      1.676
        N	     1.000     123.417	      5.306
    
    This weighs 24.819 amu.
    
    Absorption length = 0.077 cm at 7800 eV.
    
    A sample of 1 absorption length with area of 1 square
    cm requires 175.278 milligrams of sample at 7800.00 eV.
    
    The Elam database and the full cross-sections were
    used in the calculation.
</pre>

<p>

This reports on an important physical parameter, the &ldquo;absorption
length&rdquo;.  This is defined as the length of sample over which the
intensity of the incident beam will be attenuated by 1/e, or about
63%, at the specified energy.  Note that absorption length is an
energy dependent parameter and that it changes significantly across an
absorption edge.
</p>

<p>
Here we see that 9000 eV photons will be e-fold attenuated in just
over 1 millimeter of packed BN.  To make a sample with an area of 1
square centimeter facing the beam and which has an absorption length
of 1, one must weigh out about 175 milligrams of BN.  In practice,
this is quite a lot of BN and will make a rather thick pellet.  One
might weigh out a fraction of the 175 milligrams for a real sample,
giving the matrix that much less than 1 absorption length.
</p>

<p>
As another example, here is the calculation on cobalt ferrite,
CoFe2O4, which has a specific gravity of about 5.  Computing the cross
section at 7800 eV will trigger a calculation of the sample depth
corresponding to a unit edge step at the Co K edge.  This additional
calculation is triggered because the calculation energy, 7800 eV, is
within 100 eV of the Co K edge energy of 7709 eV.
</p>



<pre>
      element   number   barns/atom     cm^2/gm
     --------- ----------------------------------
        Co	     1.000   33808.991	    345.519
        Fe	     2.000   30183.487	    325.464
        O	     4.000     333.532	     12.553
    
    This weighs 234.633 amu.
    
    Absorption length = 8.2 micron at 7800 eV.
    
    A sample of 1 absorption length with area of 1 square
    cm requires 4.079 milligrams of sample at 7800.00 eV.
    
    Unit edge step length at Co K edge (7709.0 eV) is 28.3
    microns
    
    The Elam database and the full cross-sections were
    used in the calculation.
</pre>

<p>

Here we introduce a second important physical parameter, the &ldquo;unit
edge step length&rdquo;.  This is defined as the length over which the total
absorption will change by a factor of 1/e as  the incident beam energy
is scanned over the absorption edge.  To say that another way, the
absorption will be e-fold greater just above the edge than just below
the edge.  With that length of sample, the edge step of a transmission
XAS scan will be 1.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you wanted to mix some cobalt ferrite with 35 milligrams
(i.e. an amount that will contribute 0.2 to the total absorption of
the sample) of boron nitride measured above in order to make a good
transmission XAS sample.  That amount of BN contributes 0.2 absorption
lengths to the total thickness of the sample at this energy.  Weighing
out 4 milligrams of ferrite, then, gives the sample a total absorption
of 1.2.  That is, the beam passing through the sample will attenuate
to the level of exp(-1.2), or about 30%, of the intensity of the
incident beam.
</p>

<p>
Note that this sample has more Fe than Co and that the calculation
energy is above the Fe K edge energy.  The Fe part of the sample is
rather absorbing at this energy.  As a result, a relatively small
mass of sample constitutes an absorption length.
</p>

<p>
The 4 milligrams of sample required for one absorption length is
distributed over 8.2 microns.  The unit edge step calculation tells us
that the edge step will be one with 28.3 microns of sample.  Thus, the
sample with one absorption length of ferrite will have an edge step of
8.2/28.3 = 0.34.
</p>

<p>
A sample with an edge step of 1 is made by mixing 28.3 milligrams of
ferrite with the BN.  This sample, however, will be rather thick
around the Co K edge.  28.3 milligrams represents 2.9 (= 1/0.34)
absorption lengths of ferrite.  The ferrite in BN will, therefore,
attenuate the beam passing through the sample to the level of
exp(-3.1), or about 4.5%.
</p>

<p>
In an early XAS paper -- E. A. Stern and K. Kim, <em>Physical Review</em> <strong>23</strong>:8 (1981) (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.23.3781">DOI link</a>) -- it
was shown that the edge step of a sample should not exceed 1.5.  Using
a simple statistical argument that presumes that measurement
uncertainty is dominated by shot noise, the authors show that a sample
is optimized when the total absorption is 2.6.  In this case, the
sample of ferrite in BN can be made such that both total absorption
and edge step are close to optimal.  For instance, making the sample
with 2 absorption lengths (i.e. 8 milligrams or 16.4 microns) of
ferrite will result in an edge step of 0.68 -- an excellent sample!
Not all materials -- particularly those for which a minority dopant is
the target of the XAS experiment -- work out so well.  In practice,
sample preparation is an exercise in compromise between total
absorption and size of edge step.
</p>

<p>
Two final notes:
</p>


<ol>
  
<li><p>
The calculation of absorption length in units of length, in this case
8.2 microns, is another useful metric for high quality sample
preparation.  To mix ferrite powder with BN to obtain a nicely
homogeneous sample, it is necessary that the ferrite powder be
composed of grains that are small compared to the absorption length.
In this, you would want micron-sized or smaller grains.  Note that a
stack of laboratory metal meshes are not adequate for separating out
powders for this sample.  A 400 mesh -- usually the finest one in a
common stack of sieves -- has openings of 37 microns.  That is vastly
too large for your ferrite XAS samples!
</p></li>
<li><p>
Transmission XAS samples are often made with 10s of milligrams of
material.  That is true for the example given above and, indeed, for
many materials science problems.  10s of milligrams of sample is a
very small quantity.  That material must be distributed in the beam
uniformly and packaged in a manner that can be readily handled.
What's more, the sample may need to survive placement in a cryostat, a
furnace, or some other in situ environment.  In the example given
above, reference is made to boron nitride.  BN is often used a sample
matrix by mixing the sample thoroughly in the BN and pressing the
mixed powders into a pellet using a hydrolic press.  This results in a
sample which is thick enough to manage by hand and sturdy enough for a
cryostat or furnace.  Other materials are commonly used for this
purpose, such as graphite, polyethylene glycol, and sucrose.
</p></li>
</ol>


<hr class=hide />
<a name="ionchambers">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</a>

<h2>  Ion Chambers</h2>

<p>

This tool is used to determine appropriate contents of ion chambers at
a given energy.  The calculation requires several parameters,
including
</p>


<ol>
  
<li><p>
The length in centimeters of the ion chamber.  This can be selected
from a list of common lengths or supplied by the user.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The relative fractions of two gasses mixed together in the ion
chambers.  Each can be selected from a list which includes H2, N2, Ar,
Ne, Kr, and Xe.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The pressure of the gas inside the ion chamber, in Torr.  Atmospheric
pressure is 760 Torr.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>

The percentage absorbed by the ion chamber will usually auto-update as
you change the parameters.  Clicking the &ldquo;Compute&rdquo; button forces an update.  Clicking the &ldquo;Reset&rdquo; button returns all the parameters to their
initial values.
</p>

<p>
As a rule of thumb, 10% is a good amount of absorption for the I0
chamber.  This will allow for a good measurement of incidence flux
while leaving most photons for the rest of the measurement.  66
percent is a good amount for the It, Ir, and If chambers.  This
distributes the absorption over the entire length of the ion chamber.
In the case of It, this leaves enough photons passing through to the
reference chamber to allow for a reasonable measurement on Ir.
</p>

<p>
If you know the amplifier gain and voltage signal coming from your
current-to-voltage amplifier (such as a Keithley 427 or 428),
specifying these will compute a crude calculation of photon flux
incident upon the chamber.

This tool displays a table, ordered by increasing edge energy, of all
edge energies on the periodic table.  The table also shows the edge
energies in wavelength units and the core-hole lifetimes.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of this tool is to aid in identifying edges observed during
measurements.  To search the list, enter an energy in the text box on
the right and click search (or hit return).  The list will be
recentered around that energy.  Hopefully this will help you identify
the mysterious feature in your measured data!
</p>

<p>
You can also search for edges at the second or third harmonic of the
energy.  This can be useful in the case of poor harmonic rejection in
the incident beam and the excitation of a much higher energy edge.

<h2>  Line Finder</h2>

<p>

This tool displays a table, ordered by increasing emission energy, of
all emission line energies on the periodic table.  The table also
shows the emission energies in wavelength units and the strength (or
branching ratio) of each line relative to the other lines arising from
the same absorption edge.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of this tool is to aid in identifying emission lines
observed during measurements.  To search the list, enter an energy in
the text box on the right and click search (or hit return).  The list
will be recentered around that energy.  Hopefully this will help you
identify the mysterious line in your fluorescence data!

<h2>  Standards</h2>

<p>

Demeter is distributed with a small library of data on standard
materials.  These XANES spectra can be access via this tool.  You will
find that this library is quite tiny at this time.  The hope is that a
future effort in an XAS standards library will take off.  When that
happens, this will be <span class=program>HEPHAESTUS</span>' interface to that effort.
</p>

<p>
Clicking on an element in the periodic table displays a list of all
the standards in the library measured for that element.  The disabled
elements in the periodic table are ones for which the library has no
entries. 
</p>

<p>
The XANES data can be plotted as normalized mu(E) or as the derivative
of mu(E).  The data present have all been annotated so that
interesting points are marked on the plots.
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;Save&rdquo; button will prompt for a file
name and save the mu(E) data to a file.
</p>

<p>
One point of this tool is to make obsolete the &ldquo;Reference Spectra&rdquo; printout from EXAFS Materials that is found at
many beamlines.  <a href="http://exafsmaterials.com/Ref_Spectra_0.4MB.pdf">http://exafsmaterials.com/Ref_Spectra_0.4MB.pdf</a>

<h2>  F' and F"</h2>

<p>

This tool plots the complex anomalous scattering data from the
Cromer-Liberman tables as a function of energy.  The start and end
energies for the plot are entered, as well as the energy grid
spacing.  When an element is selected from the periodic table, it's f'
and f" values are plotted.
</p>

<p>
Anomalous scattering for elements can be plotted alone or over-plotted
with other elements.  You can also select to plot either f', f", or
both.
</p>

<p>
The f' and f" data can be saved to a file.

<h2>  Preferences</h2>

<p>

The behavior of <span class=program>HEPHAESTUS</span> can be configured via the preferences
tool.  This uses the same preferences tool as Athena and Artemis,
although only those preference groups relevant to <span class=program>HEPHAESTUS</span> and to
plotting are presented.
</p>

<p>
Click on a group in the &ldquo;Parameters&rdquo; list to open a group.  Click on a
parameter to display it in the controls on the right. You will be
given controls appropriate to each parameter's data type for setting
the parameter value.  The &ldquo;Your value&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;Demeter's value&rdquo; buttons
can be used to restore a parameter's value.  A description of the
displayed parameter will be written in the large text box.
</p>

<p>
Parameters can be applied for the current session or applied and saved
to your configuration file.

<li><p>
The layout of <span class=program>HEPHAESTUS</span> -- with its button bar on the left side which
changes the mode of the main part of the program -- was inspired by
the personal information management program I use on my KDE systems,
Kontact. I found it effective so I swiped it for this program.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The pictures used on the buttons were cropped from images I found
using Google. The picture of the ion chamber is from the Advanced
Designed Consulting web site.  Their ion chambers are quite nice.  The
edge finder icon was swiped from the <span class=file>find.png</span> icon in the kid's
icon theme for KDE.  The line finder icon is from a web page by the
Alberta Synchrotron Institute and depicts a fluorescence map of some
rock.  The documentation icon was found under a Creative Commons
license at <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001952.php">http://battellemedia.com/archives/001952.php</a>
</p></li>
<li><p>
The formulas utility owes much to Gerry Roe, who pointed out a bug,
and Erik Gullikson, whose similar utility on the web set me straight.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The information used in the chemical data utility is from the
<span class=file>kalziumrc</span> file, which was swiped from the Kalzium package.  See
<a href="http://edu.kde.org/kalzium/">http://edu.kde.org/kalzium/</a> for more details.  The data for
Mossbauer active isotopes was taken from <a href="http://www.mossbauer.org">http://www.mossbauer.org</a>
</p></li>
<li><p>
The ion chamber and edge finder utilities were inspired by the similar
utilities in the data acquisition program by Lars Fuerenlid and Johnny
Kirkland and in wide use at NSLS.  Lars and Johnny seem to have a
deeper love of pastel than do I.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The electronic transitions chart was created from scratch but
slavishly following Figure 1.1 in the Center for X-Ray Optics X-Ray
Data Booklet.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<span class=program>HEPHAESTUS</span> makes use of the and several things from
<a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a>

And, of course, the users of my various software efforts deserve all
the credit for kind praise and useful feedback over these many years.

<h2>  Bugs and limitations</h2>

<p>

Every calculation at high energy is inaccurate in <span class=program>HEPHAESTUS</span>.
Xray::Absorption does not correctly handle the mass-energy absorption
coefficients at high energy, although the ion chamber utility does
attempt a (very) crude correction.
</p>

<p>
More types of information can be added to the chemical data utility.
If there is something you would like to see, you should send the data
in an easily readable format (i.e. plain text is lovely).  Merely
suggesting new data types is unlikely to have any effect.  Supplying
the data is highly likely to have an effect.
</p>

<p>
My wish list includes auger/fluorescence branching ratios in one of
the periodic table utilities and providing the Berger/Hubble XCOM
tables and Feff's optical calculations as data resources.
