This section outlines the linear combination fitting analysis of an
experiment to study the kinetics of the reduction of aqueous Au<sup>3+</sup>
chloride to metallic gold.  The experiment is described and these data
are presented in
<em>Mechanisms of Gold Bioaccumulation by
Filamentous Cyanobacteria from Gold(III)-Chloride Complex</em>,
M.F. Lengke, B. Ravel, M.E. Fleet, G. Wanger, R.A. Gordon, G. Southam, <em>Environ. Sci. Technol.</em>, <strong>40:20</strong>, 
(2006) p.&nbsp;6304-6309<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/es061040r"> (DOI: 10.1021/es061040r)</a>.
</p>

<p>
The experiment probed the mechanism of bioaccumulation of gold by the
interaction of a model cyanobacterium (Plectonema boryanum UTEX 485)
with aqueous Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride.  This resembles a common subsurface
environment associated with gold deposits in various locations around
the world.  In those environments, Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride bearing fluids
rise from the deep subsurface and wash over bacterial mats.  The
bacteria die but their remains interact chemically, reducing metallic
gold from the fluid.
</p>

<p>
In our experiment, a culture of P. boryanum was sampled and placed in
a Teflon fluid cell appropriate for an XAS measurement.  An aliquot
of Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride solution was titrated into the fluid cell and we
exited the hutch as quickly as possible.  Overnight, we measured XAS
scans continuously.  In the morning we set the sample aside,
remeasuring it every few hours until the end of the experiment.
Finally we measured a similar sample that had been prepared a week
earlier.  in this way, we had a time sequence tracking the nearly
complete reduction of Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride to some form of colloidal
gold.  (The gold is known to be colloidal from TEM measurements, we
could not distinguish colloidal and bulk gold in our XAS measurements.)
</p>



<p>

A project file conatining all the data shown here can be found at
<a href="https://github.com/bruceravel/XAS-Education/tree/master/Examples/Au%2BCyanobacteria">my Github site</a>.

<h2>  Examining the data</h2>

<p>

Import the <span class=program>ATHENA</span> project file containing the gold standards and
gold/cyanobacteria data.  You will see that it contains a subset of
the reduction sequence, including data data from 0.12 hours through 1
week.  Below the cyanobacteria data are several gold standards.
</p>

<p>
Note that these data have all been carefully calibrated, aligned, and
merged.  Each measurement was made using a gold foil as an
<a href="../import/ref.html">alignment reference</a>.
</p>

<p>
The figure below
shows the sequence of data measured on the cyanobacteria on the left
and a variety of gold standards on the right.  The plot on the left
also shows the starting material, aqueous Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride, and the end
product, metallic gold.  The data clearly show the transformation over
time between these two end members.  In particular, note the reduction
of the white line intensity at about 11921.5 eV and the growth of the
peak at about 11946.7 eV which is characteristic of the metallic gold
spectrum.
</p>

(Left) The sequence of measurements from 0.12 through 720 hours.  The
top-most trace shows the starting material,aqueous  Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride.  The
bottom trace shows the end product, metallic gold.  (Right) All of the
standards contained in the project file.
</p>
</div>

<p>

The purpose of this experiment is two-fold.  One goal is to determine
the reaction kinetics of the reduction.  To that end, we will assume
that the data are a linear combination of aqueous Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride
and metallic gold and measure their relative fractions as a function
of time.  The second goal is to determine whether the reduction
involves an intermediate state and, if so, to identify that species.
Our strategy to answer that question will involve adding other
standard compound to our mixture of aqueous Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride and
metallic gold to see if the data are better described by a ternary
rather than binary mixture of standard materials.
</p>

<p>
To begin, select one of the time points in the group list.  Most
figures in this section show the data measured at 7.03 hours.  Next,
select &ldquo;Linear combination fit&rdquo; from the
main menu.  This replaces the main window with the linear
combination fitting tool and plots the data along with vertical
lines indicating the extent of the fitting range.  From the first two
drop-down menus, select &ldquo;Au foil&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Au3 Cl aq&rdquo;, as shown
below.

<p>

In the operations list, click on &ldquo;Fit this group&rdquo;
to perform the initial fit to these data.  After the fit finishes, the
result of the fit, shown
below is
plotted.  The tab labeled &ldquo;Fit results&rdquo;
becomes active.  Clicking on it, we see that the fit tells us that the
data are 51&plusmn;1 percent metallic gold.  Given the quality of the
fit, it seems that we are well justified in our assumption that these
data can be modeled by a simple linear combination of the end members.

<h2>  Improving the fit</h2>

<p>

As nice as this quick and easy result is, it's not perfect.  A close
examination of the plot
above shows
quite a bit of misfit throughout the entire fitting range.  (Note that
you can examine the misfit by clicking the
&ldquo;Plot difference&rdquo; button and replotting the
data by clicking &ldquo;Plot data + sum&rdquo; in the
operations list.)  This misfit suggests that our hypothesis of an
intermediate state between Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride and metallic gold may be
valid.
</p>

<p>
As a first guess for what that intermediate state might be, I think
should be something without a strong white line.  The fit in the
region of the white line is pretty good.  Looking at the various
standards on the right side of
the first figure on this page
I suspect that the sulfur ligated species, Au sulfide, Au
thiosulfate, or Au thiomalate, are likely candidates.  To test one, we
need to add it to the list of fitting standards on the
&ldquo;Standards spectra&rdquo; tab and rerun the fit.
In the third row, select &ldquo;Au sulfide&rdquo; from
the drop-down menu, then click
&ldquo;Fit this group&rdquo; from the operations list.
</p>

members along with gold sulfide.
</p>
</div>

<p>

This is a noticeably better fit.  The amount of misfit throughout the
fitting range and especially in the peak at about 11946.7 eV is
smaller.  Examining the results tab, we see that the amount of Au<sup>3+</sup>
chloride is about the same as before but that the metallic gold
content is only 34&plusmn;2 percent, with the sulfide taking up the
remaining 18&plusmn;2 percent.
</p>


<hr class=hide />
<a name="understandingthefit">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</a>

<h2>  Understanding the fit</h2>

<p>

The fit including the sulfide certainly looks better, but is it?  The
results tab also reports some simple statistics from the fit.  The
R-factor -- a measure of mean square sum of the misfit at each data
point -- was 0.000073 for the two-standard fit and shrank by a factor
of 2 to 0.000035 for the three-standard fit.  That confirms the
observation that the degree of misfit seems smaller in the plot of
the three-standard fit.
</p>

<p>
The reduced &chi;&sup2; of the fit also reduced by about a factor of
two, from 0.0000514 to 0.0000250, suggesting a substantive improvement
in the fit quality.  Those are strange numbers, though.  Any textbook
on scientific statistics will tell us that a good fit using a
non-linear, least-squares minimization (such as that used by
<span class=program>IFEFFIT</span> and <span class=program>ATHENA</span>) should give 1 for a fit in which the
model is a good representation of the data.  That is certainly true,
but supposes that you have a good determination of the measurement
uncertainty.  We don't.  In principle, the standard deviation spectrum
from the <a href="../process/merge.html">merge of measured data</a> could be used as an approximation of
the measurement uncertainty, but that is not possible in this case.
The data at 7.03 hours are a single measurement from a time sequence.
There is nothing to merge because each measurement is a solitary
measurement.  Consequently, <span class=program>ATHENA</span> has to use 1 as the value of
the measurement uncertainty.  That is grossly in excess of the true
measurement uncertainty, resulting in very small values for &chi;&sup2;.
</p>

<p>
We cannot, therefore, assert that any particular fit is a good fit
simply by invoking what we know about Gaussian statistics.  We can,
however, compare successive fits, such as the two we have made thus
far.  An improvement of a factor of 2 in the value of reduced
&chi;&sup2; is certainly significant.  We can, with confidence, state
that there is an intermediate component on the basis of the analysis
presented thus far.
</p>

<p>
But what is that intermediate.  We have not yet proven its identity
(although gold sulfide is a strong contender!) because we have not yet
considered other options.  There are two algorithmically distinct but
conceptually identical ways to attempt to solve this problem.  One
involves the use of principle component analysis (a feature not yet
available in <span class=program>ATHENA</span>) of the data followed by target transform
analysis to attempt to identify the third species from among the
standards.  The approach discussed here involves using combinatorial
techniques to directly test a library of standards against our data.
</p>

<p>
The mathematics of these two approaches is quite different.  Since
they share one major limitation, they are practically equivalent ways
of identifying the intermediate state.  The limitation is that both
approaches require that the intermediate species be represented by the
library of standards.  If that unknown species is absent from the
library, neither technique is able to identify it.
</p>

<a name="combinatorialanalysis">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</a>

<h2>  Combinatorial analysis</h2>

<p>

Testing each standard against the data sounds like an unbearably
boring process -- particularly since we may, in principle, want to
consider all possible binary, ternary, or higher combinations of
standards.  The project file contains 9 standards.  All possible
combinations of 2 or 3 standards from a pool of 9 results in 120
possibilities.  Performing and recording the results from that many
fits sounds horrible.  Fortunately, <span class=program>ATHENA</span> knows how to automate
that chore.
</p>

<p>
First mark all of the standards and none of the cyanobacteria data.
Then click the &ldquo;Use marked groups&rdquo; button.
This will insert all of the standards into the table.
</p>

<p>
By default, the table is only four rows long.  You will need to exit
the linear combination fitting tool and open the
<a href="../other/prefs.html">preference tool</a>.
Set the <span class=pref>&diams;Linearcombo&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;maxspectra</span>
preference to at least 9.  Return to the linear combination tool and
load the 9 standards into the table.
</p>

<p>
Click the &ldquo;Use at most&rdquo; control down to
three.  At this point you could click
&ldquo;Fit all combinations&rdquo; to begin fitting all
120 combinations of 2 and 3 standards.  This is, however, a bit of a
waste of time.  We <strong>know</strong> that there is
metallic gold in these data.  The fifth column in the table of
standards is labeled &ldquo;req.&rdquo;, which is short
for <em>required</em>.  Click the radiobutton in the
&ldquo;Au foil&rdquo; row.  This will cause the
combinatorial sequence to only consider combinations which include the
metallic gold standard.  This reduces the number of binary and ternary
combinations to 36.  Now click
&ldquo;Fit all combinations&rdquo; in the operations
list.  This will take a while.  It's a good time to get a cup of coffee.
</p>



<div class=figure style="max-width: 764px; min-width: 7em;">

</a>
<p align=center>
The results of the combinatorial fitting sequence, as displayed on the
in the &ldquo;combinatorics&rdquo; tab.
</p>
</div>

<p>

Once the sequence of fits finishes, <span class=program>ATHENA</span> displays tables
containing the results of all of the fits in order of increasing
R-factor.  The first column of the top table shows which standards
were included in the fits using the numbering scheme of the bottom
table.  The other two columns show the R-factor and reduced
&chi;&sup2; of each fit.
</p>

<p>
When you click on a row in the top table, the results of that fit are
inserted into the bottom table and the fit is plotted.  When the
combinatorial sequence finishes, the best fit of the bunch is
displayed.  It turns out the the combination of gold metal, aqueous Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride, and gold sulfide that we examined above is, in fact,
the best fit.  However, it is juts barely the best fit.  The fit with
gold thiomalate in place of gold sulfide is just barely worse.  From a
statistical perspective, the two fits are equivalent and the amounts
of metal and chloride in the fits are very similar.  The gold
thiosulfate and gold thiocyanide fits are just a bit worse yet.  A
couple of other fits show similar statistics but an investigation
shows that the peak around 11946.7 eV is not fit very well.  After
that, the other fits in the table fall off quickly in quality.
</p>

<p>
The conclusion that one can comfortably draw from this is that the
intermediate species is some sort of gold-sulfur complex.  The aqueous
gold sulfide standard gave the best result by a hair, but the other
three species with a gold-sulfur ligand were statistically similar.
To model the kinetics in this system, I will use the sulfide species,
but it is probably not correct to say that the intermediate species is
aqueous gold sulfide.  Rather it is some gold-sulfur complex formed
when the cyanobacteria bacteria cells lyse upon exposure to the
Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride solution.</p>



<hr class=hide />
<a name="analyzingthedataseries">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</a>

<h2>  Analyzing the data series</h2>

<p>

To investigate the kinetics of this system, we will now apply the
model consisting of three species -- metal, chloride, and sulfide --
to the cyanobacteria measured at each time step.  Click on the top
line of the upper table.  This will plot the result for our best fit.
It will also insert those three standards into the table on the
&ldquo;Standards spectra&rdquo; tab.  Click on that
tab, then mark all the cyanobacteria data groups and unmark all of the
standards in the group list.  Now click on
&ldquo;Fit marked groups&rdquo; in the operations list.
This will step through the marked groups, applying the three-standard
fitting model to each one.  Again, you may want to relax as you wait.

<p>

Once the sequence of fits finishes, you may want to click through the
data groups and examine the fits at the various time steps.  Note that
the &ldquo;Marked fits report&rdquo; option in the
operations list becomes active.  Clicking on this prompts you for a
name for an output file.  This output file is a comma separated value
text file which can be easily imported into a spreadsheet, much like
one of <span class=program>ATHENA</span>'s <a href="../output/report.html">report files</a>.  In
this figure we see
that the metal content increases monotonically while the chloride
content decreases monotonically.  The column with the sulfide content
is not seen in the image, but it remains roughly constant throughout
the experiment.

<p>

In this example, I have outlined the analysis performed in the paper
cited at the beginning of the chapter.  We have, as we set out to do,
examined the reaction kinetics and tentatively identified an
intermediate species.  Using automation built right into <span class=program>ATHENA</span>
it was relatively easy to manage a large quantity of data.
